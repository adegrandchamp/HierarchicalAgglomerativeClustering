# HierarchicalAgglomerativeClustering
Data cleaning and clustering project centered on BRFSS dataset

The US Centers for Disease Control conduct an expansive annual, national telephone survey of American households to identify trends in health behaviors. This survey, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, produces one of the richest datasets on American attitudes towards health and preventative care. 

This project uses the 2015 BRFSS survey to begin to identify clusters of behavior female-identified respondents exhibit towards women's health topics. The dataset required extensive cleaning; the first cleaning script addresses the dataset as a whole, and the second is focused only on those indicators relevant to women's health topics. The final script tunes a hierarchical agglomerative clustering model to ascertain the respondents' groupings. 

Submitted as part of a group presentation for final project, DePaul University's DSC 424, Advanced Data Analysis. All code within this repository is solely my own.

This work is meant to be an example of my approach to scripted data cleaning for a specific ad hoc analysis. The code is not intended to be reusable outside of the BRFSS dataset.
